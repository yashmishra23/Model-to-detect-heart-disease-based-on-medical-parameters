# Model-to-detect-heart-disease-based-on-medical-parameters
This project builds a machine learning model to predict heart disease using medical parameters like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol. A Random Forest classifier is trained on patient data to classify heart disease presence. The model aids early diagnosis through evaluation metrics and visualizations.
